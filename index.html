            <h3>The Ghost Of Uchiha</h3>
            <p>Madara was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival Hashirama, with the intention of finding peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death.</p>
